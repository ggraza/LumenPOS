"""The languages the till speaks, and which of them a shop offers.

A language is shipped when LumenPOS carries its server translations
(translations/<code>.csv, the file Frappe itself reads on v13 to v16); the
till's own texts for it sit in frontend/src/locales. The code is the ERPNext
Language code, so the till sends it as Frappe's `_lang` and every message,
LumenPOS's and ERPNext's, comes back in the language on the screen.

`till_languages` on LumenPOS Settings narrows the list, one code per line.
Empty means every shipped language, including ones a later release adds.
English is always offered: it is what a missing text falls back to."""
